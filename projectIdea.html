            <h3>What is ToDoTopia?</h3>
            <div id="paragraphs">
                <p>The aim is to build a web-based application that links into workplace productivity, work in progress
                    and time tracking applications to gamify Individual employee and team workloads. The application
                    will ultimately be a web- based computer games platform that allows users to gain experience points
                    (xp) for work done. By gamifying daily work tasks employees and Teams are incentivized by gaining
                    experience points (Xp) to use towards building objects, such as characters or Armies in a computer
                    game. The idea is not only to incentivize teams and help increase productivity but to foster a
                    friendly but competitive workplace. Individuals can play off against team members with the
                    characters or Armies they have built up through completing work tasks over time. Workplaces could
                    host a “game-off” as part of a weekly/monthly winddown or after a sprint or after a project go live.

            <h3>Why Gamification</h3>
            <div id="paragraphs">
                <p>Gamification of tasks is not necessarily a new idea, Companies such as Habitica have been doing it
                    for a while now in a way of making your daily task and activities rewarding by giving you a
                    character who starts at level one and has no items. The idea is that you self-appoint yourself tasks
                    and as you complete those tasks you are rewarded with better equipment to help your character
                    progress. However, these applications are more on an individual basis and the game play is limited.
                    Keeping a team motivated during a project can be difficult, but gamification has shown to keep the
                    attention of employees and increase their productivity.</p>

                <p>What is gamification? Gamification at its core is turning work into play. There is a model known as
                    Octalysis that explains in detail the eight core drives that gamify something whether it be a task
                    at work or a video game. </p>

                <div>
                    <img id="octo" src="Images/octagon.png">
                </div>

                <p>These eight core drives are listed below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Epic Meaning and calling </li>
                    <li>Development and Accomplishment </li>
                    <li>Empowerment and Creativity </li>
                    <li>Ownership and Possession </li>
                    <li>Social Influence and Relatedness </li>
                    <li>Scarcity and Impatience </li>
                    <li>Unpredictability </li>
                    <li>Loss and Avoidance </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div id="paragraphs">
                <p>Every good game consists of these eight properties, and they can be used to motivate people and keep
                    them focused. This is the motivation for ToDoTopia, to use gamification to turn completing tasks in
                    a Jira Kanban board into a game.<p>

            <h3>Why ToDoTopia?</h3>
            <div id="paragraphs">
                <p>Keeping employees motivated when there are tight deadlines and large workloads can be tricky.
                    Employees are not robots, to stay driven they need a sense of value and purpose.<br><br>

                    Tim Pickard’s article in <a
                        href="https://www.business.com/articles/5-statistics-that-prove-gamification-is-the-future-of-the-workplace/">business.com</a>
                    sights Gartner as noting “70% of business transformation efforts fail due to lack of
                    engagement.”<br><br>

                    <a
                        href="https://incentiveandmotivation.com/70-per-cent-business-transformation-efforts-fail-due-lack-engagement/">Incentive
                        and Motion</a> also notes this same Gartner reference and the article in addition references Aon
                    Hewitt’s <a
                        href="https://www.aonhumancapital.com.au/AON.Marketing/media/Australia/pdf/Resources/Reports%20and%20research/2017-trends-in-global-employee-engagement.pdf">2017
                        Trends in Global Employee Engagement Study</a> which “suggests that less than 63% of employees
                    feel engaged at work. That means almost 40% of your people are feeling disengaged from their jobs
                    right now.”<br><br>

                    ToDoTopia provides a platform in which employees can stay motivated and enthused to clear workloads
                    and stay in touch with deadlines. By gamifying team workloads and providing a platform for employees
                    to engage each other in a social environment. ToDoTopia provides an outlet whereby employees can
                    compete against each other fostering a fun and collaborative workplace. </p>

                <h3>ToDoTopia Web Application</h3>
                <p>The web application will be the main platform. It will be a cloud-based application that will host
                    the computer game. This will be the main space point for ToDoTopia and will provide a focal point
                    for workplace interaction and fun. Each company or business enterprise will have a company space.
                    Each user will have a space on their company’s ToDoTopia page. In addition, each company space will
                    have an administration role assigned. </p>

                <h3>Api links to workplace productivity, work in progress and time tracking applications</h3>
                <p>Most enterprises these days use some form of third-party web application that tracks work in progress
                    (wip), Such as Atlassian’s Jira, Microsoft’s Azure DevOps and salesforce. The Idea is for the
                    ToDoTopia Computer games platform to link into these applications via there respective API’s.
                    Research will be needed to discover what companies will offer or allow an API integration into their
                    platform but looking into developer documentation both <a
                        href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/?view=azure-devops">Azure Dev
                        Ops</a> and <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/rest/intro/">Jira</a>
                    offer some form of third party integration.</p>

                <h3>So how does it all work?</h3>
                <p>When a company decides they wish to gamify their teams work using ToDoTopia they will be able to
                    integrate their workplace productivity, work in progress and time tracking applications. A good
                    example of this would be the <a
                        href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/boards/kanban-quickstart?view=azure-devops">Azure
                        DevOps Kanban Board</a></p>

                <div id="kanbanBoard">
                    <img id="kanbanBoard" src="Images/Kanban_Board.png">

                </div>

                <p>When it comes to work in progress (wip) the Kanban board is king. As you can see the board is broken
                    down into tasks. Each task is numbered (weighted) using story points which represent the Effort
                    level of the Task. The range of effort Levels are set by the company and can vary. </p>

                <h3>Gaining Experiance Points(XP)</h3>
                <p>ToDoTopia games rely on individual users gaining Experience points or Xp. When a task is completed
                    the user, who completed the task gains Xp. The Xp is allocated to their ToDoTopia profile in the
                    main Web application. The Xp is directly proportional to the size of the task completed so, for
                    example a task with a story point of 1 could equal 1000Xp and a task with a story point of 5 could
                    equal 5000Xp. Users will also be able to see the Xp they will earn on the task itself (research will
                    be needed to see if the respective API will allow this).
                </p>

                <p><img id="XP_Clip" src="Images/gaining_Xp.png" alt="Displaying XP to User"></p>

                <h3>Using Experiance points</h3>
                <p>When a user logs into the ToDoTopia Games platform they will be able to see all the Experience Points
                    (Xp) they have earned. Users can then use these Experience Points (Xp) towards building objects,
                    such as characters or Armies in the game. </p>

                <h3>What is the Game</h3>
                <p>There are many possibilities for the game and over time several different games could be developed.
                    However, as a minimum Viable product (MVP) we have decided to go with a game that people can play
                    off against each other in teams of up to three (So 3v3 or 2v2 1v1). The game is a Real-time strategy
                    game (RTS) where opponents play off against each other with their armies. Similar types of games
                    would be:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_of_Heroes">Company of Heros</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.badnorth.com/">Bad North</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000:_Dawn_of_War">Dawn of War</a></li>
                </ul>

                <div id="dawnOfWarGameplay">
                    <img id="dawnOfWarGameplay" src="Images/dawnOfWarGameplay%20(1).png">

                </div>

                <p>While we thought about many possible types of games, City-building games etc. we thought that the
                    possibility of annihilating your co-worker(s) on a Friday after a hard week of work would make for a
                    very satisfying winddown. </p>

                <h3>Administration roles and users</h3>
                <p>Within each company space there will be an administration role and each company can set several users
                    to this role. The administration role would generally be reserved for team leads and managers as it
                    will also provide some metrics into a user’s work patterns. </p>
                <h4>User Area</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>User Profiles
                        <ul>
                            <h4>Each user has a profile that documents a user’s activities this will include but may not
                                be limited to: </h4>
                            <li>Name of user</li>
                            <li>Name of Company</li>
                            <li>Name of any in game teams they belong to</li>
                            <li>Experiance points (XP) earned</li>
                            <li>Experience points (Xp) spent</li>
                            <li>Experience points (Xp) leftover</li>
                            <li>Army details for the game (types of units purchesed e.t.c)</li>
                        </ul><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Army Builder
                        <ul><br>
                            <li>The army builder is where users can spend Xp to purchase new units, add upgrades to
                                units, repair units etc </li>
                        </ul><br>
                    <li>Users army
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is an area where a user can view their army (perhaps personalise with a colour
                                picker) and what units they have bought and lost, (could also be a graveyard area) </li>
                        </ul><br>
                    <li>Leader Board
                        <ul>
                            <li>This would be a companywide leaderbord users would gain points for competing in winning
                                games. </li>
                        </ul>


                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are many aspects and finer details to the game that will need to be ironed out such as allowing
                    units to gain XP for the user in battle, allowing units to become more powerful and experienced if
                    they survive a battle. </p>

                <h3>Administration area for mangers </h3>
                <p>The Administration area for managers is predominantly set about to provide structure to the
                    game.,<br> This role has the ability to: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manage the game setup in terms of XP vs WIP
                        <ul>
                            <li>Managers will be able to specify how much Xp a user will gain per task for example let’s
                                say the company uses a story points value of 1-5 with 5 being hardest and 1 being
                                easiest. Managers will be able to set Xp to match the value of the story points e.g.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>1 story point = 1000XP</li>
                                    <li>2 story point = 2000XP</li>
                                    <li>3 story point = 3000XP</li>
                                    <li>4 story point = 4000XP</li>
                                    <li>5 story point = 5000XP</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Administrator leader board metrics
                        <ul>
                            <li>The provision for managers to see how many Xp a team member as earned and what
                                stories/tasks they worked on to earn Xp could be a useful insight to how their Team
                                member is tracking. It may suggest educational needs and gaps for the employee. </li>
                        </ul><br>

                            <li>Administrator’s will be able to allocate the cost of army units based on how power full
                                the unit is for example
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Tank = 1000XP</li>
                                    <li>Commando Unit = 500XP</li>
                                    <li>Infantry Unit = 300XP</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The idea behind this is to that Xp vs wip can be aligned with the cost of units for the
                                game </li>
                            <li>Administrator’s will be able to align Xp with workflow so that only when a piece of work
                                reaches a certain stage (completed, Testing, in-progress etc.) will the Xp be awarded.
                            </li>
                            <li>Conversely the provision for removing Xp can be added by Administrator so that if the
                                piece of work goes backwards from say Testing to Bug or back to in-progress Team members
                                could loose Xp. This feature can be turned on or off. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Administrator user access will allow Administrators to do the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Manage user logins/sign ins</li>
                            <li>Remove users (should an employee leave</li>
                            <li>Add new employees</li>
                        </ul>

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h3>
                <p>The above represents what would be termed a MVP. We have used the Kanban Board for Microsoft’s Azure
                    DevOps as an example, but this could also be integrated with Atlassian’s Jira Kanban Board. Other
                    options for integration could be: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://monday.com/">Monday.com</a></li>
                    <li><a
                            href="https://clickup.com/teams/project-management?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=project%20management%20website&targetid=kwd-45391050&utm_campaign=project-management-search-MC-purchase&utm_content=&gclid=Cj0KCQiAuP-OBhDqARIsAD4XHpcuIHuvI7wYZ62DeTyDjUs_7Tp2nvZTLKAYYzACf59OztDezT-iG-4aAsKREALw_wcB">Clickup</a>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.visual-paradigm.com/">Visual Paradigm</a></li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>There are many tools that could be integrated but for a MVP it would be best to start with one or
                    two.<br><br>

                    Atlassian have around <a
                        href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/use-cases/who-uses-jira">65,000 +
                        Companies</a> using Jira so the potential market here could be huge. Additionally, they are an
                    incredibly proactive and approachable company and would happily work with you to achieve your
                    goals.<br><br>

                    <a href="https://discovery.hgdata.com/product/azure-devops-server">HG Insights</a> tracks currently
                    56,699 companies using Azure DevOps Server so again potential market here could be huge.<br><br>

                    For the creation of a MVP it makes sense to start with their version of a Kanban board and integrate
                    accordingly. It may be better to target one of the above two first so that the ball gets rolling and
                    a product is created. From here there is no reason that we couldn’t integrate with other planning
                    and management tools and to do lists. </p>

            <h3>Tools and Tech Skills</h3>
            <div id="paragraphs">
                <p>The concept of ToDoTopia is the use of APIs to link a Kanban Board software to our video game. Jira
                    by Atlassian will be the first application we will link to. Using JSON we will link the progress of
                    tasks, their status, their weight and which users are assigned to complete them. These properties
                    will be used for the game features of ToDoTopia such as points, XP, etc.<br><br>

                    The application will be hosted on <a
                        href="https://aws.amazon.com/?aws-products-analytics.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-analytics.sort-order=asc&aws-products-business-apps.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-business-apps.sort-order=asc&aws-products-containers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-containers.sort-order=asc&aws-products-compute.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-compute.sort-order=asc&aws-products-databases.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-databases.sort-order=asc&aws-products-fe-mobile.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-fe-mobile.sort-order=asc&aws-products-game-tech.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-game-tech.sort-order=asc&aws-products-iot.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-iot.sort-order=asc&aws-products-ml.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-ml.sort-order=asc&aws-products-mgmt-govern.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-mgmt-govern.sort-order=asc&aws-products-migration.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-migration.sort-order=asc&aws-products-network.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-network.sort-order=asc&aws-products-security.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-security.sort-order=asc&aws-products-storage.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-storage.sort-order=asc/">Amazon
                        Web Services</a> (AWS). Other options would be Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. An AWS product
                    that ToDoTopia could use is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/gamelift/">Gamelift</a>. GameLift is a
                    variety of cloud-based game servers dedicated for multiplayer games, allowing for easy scalability
                    and a low latency multiplayer experience.<br><br>

                    To design the game that ToDoTopia will based off, we will use <a
                        href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>. ToDoTopia's game will be 2.5D and web based, Unity is our
                    game engine of choice over <a
                        href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal?utm_source=GoogleSearch&utm_medium=Performance&utm_campaign=an*Internal_pr*UnrealEngine_ct*Search_pl*Brand_co*OC&utm_id=10824681733&sub_campaign=UE_Broad_EN&utm_content=existing&utm_term=unreal%20engine&gclid=CjwKCAiAlfqOBhAeEiwAYi43F8AiV6mhWXAM9zfe7S-LQAEwKrSNnYyGx9OH01SIe1LToAI_f4pnmRoCAQIQAvD_BwE/">Unreal
                        Engine</a> and <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Engine</a>. Unity is a game engine used
                    to develop games for Web plugins, desktop platforms, consoles etc. Unity is also free to use, and
                    games such as Among Us, Hollow Knight and Beat Saber on VR were made using Unity’s game engine.
                    Because we will be using Unity to develop the game, C# will be the language the game uses. </p>

                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <p>Many skills will be required to produce ToDoTopia. Full stack .net developers will be needed for the
                    main application. Developers must have the ability and experience to link platforms such as Jira and
                    DevOps to ToDoTopia using APIs. <a
                        href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2014/august/unity-developing-your-first-game-with-unity-and-csharp/">Experiance
                        with Programming games in Unity</a> and C# will be needed to develop the game. Experience with
                    AWS hosting of applications and games will be needed to get the web app up and running. Business
                    Analysis and Project managers will work alongside development teams in a Scrum approach enabling
                    rapid software development.<br><br>

                    Regarding the skills listed above, our team requires a lot of improvement. Skills such as the use of
                    APIs, Unity and C# are just some that we all need to develop, along with experience in Amazon Web
                    Services and game design. We plan on developing these skills through the duration of our Bachelor of
                    Information Technology with knowledge learned from the course and through our own exploration into
                    the subjects. </p>

        <div id="Outcome" class="tabcontent">
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <div id="paragraphs">
                <p>The Outcome of this project is to provide a web-based workplace gamification app that has the ability
                    to link into an organisation’s workplace productivity, work in progress and time tracking
                    applications. There are limited applications of this nature in the marketplace, and most are lacking
                    on computer games integration side with most games being quite basic. The main outcome is to
                    contribute to a fun, productive and competitive working environment. In addition, a leader board on
                    the web app will allow for team and individual metrics such as xp earned and the difficulty of the
                    task and the task completed, to be viewed by organization leaders. Additionally, by allowing a
                    metric in the application we can also give organization leaders a snapshot of an individual’s
                    workload and performance so that they can access and training needs and Gaps. </p> <br><br>
